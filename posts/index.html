            <p>This is what happens when you blatantly STEAL a US Pres. election. And burn down our country. And kill police officers trying to protect people. OFF WITH PELOSI'S HEAD!!! It's playing out folks. Why the surprise? We have to take back our country at ALL costs. They're just jealous we got inside 😆. It's not this country's first rodeo. A bigger question is what are Bigot & Klueless going to do?? Answer...nothing worth while. We'll come back folks. This IS NOT the end of the USA. Now it's our fault. What a joke. Like hilarious clinton said... "No matter what". This country is for people that want to work, not dumbass politicians and even dumber generation Z. The real worry right now are terrorists...Duh! Like I've said...do the math. china, fb, google, twitter, media, youth, small business destroyed, our seniors murdered, depletion....stolen election...</p>

            <p>I was there. A door was unlocked and people just started flowing in. I walked in and there was 1 police officer on a stairwell, and 6 in the hallway. The group I was with wasn’t destroying things. Wasn’t what you see on the news. That was the other side of the capitol. I went in to admire the art work took some pics then talked to a capitol police for a little bit he told me to be safe and helped me find a way out. I didn’t even realize people were trying to break into the senate and house floor. Crazy. Sad.</p>

            <p>A quick recap of my day in DC. I had to get pepper sprayed, tear gassed, hit by flash bang shrapnel, and follow those who breached the Capitol Building inside to get this report, but . . . I was there . . . start to finish. Sadly, and emotionally impacted, I was also there to witness and document the girl who was killed today. Joining me in this quick video is Edmund Wright, (author, former ghost writer for Rush Limbaugh, and columnist for Breitbart, American Thinker, and more.) We felt a need to just to get some quick thoughts out. After I have time to process everything, there will be much more. Stay tuned.</p>

             <p> I was at the Capitol when it was breached.When I first arrived at the Capitol I walked towards the steps which looked to be barricaded. People were packed shoulder-to-shoulder and younger. A mix of Trumpers and agitators were pressing against the barricades. It was not my scene so I retreated to the sidewalk in front of the Capitol as seen from the picture in my Parley. Back on the sidewalk, I was standing next to some Proud Boys and they were saying it was antifa. There were agitators, but the Trumpers piled on as soon as word circulated that Pence failed to contest the certificates. (I suspect but I did not witness the agitators broke in and opened the doors for the Trumpers.) A 40ish lady came back where I was standing rubbing her eyes. She told me they were using flash bangs and pepper spray to keep the protestors at bay. She wisely left the scene.</p>

             <p> I was at the Capitol today. The media is over blowing things. Was about a few dozen people who broke into the Capitol Building. That was about it. 10s of thousands of Republicans were peacefully assembling as this was going on.</p>

             <p> I was at the Capitol Building and saw those “Trump supporters”, and I can attest that they were acting like AGITATORS, NOT supporters, long before they stormed the building. They were marching, in a large group, shouting “F**k Antifa!” I was listening to Del Bigtree with my patriot friends. We thought they were Antifa dressed as supporters.</p>

             <p> As per Pence weak and treasonous response , it’s up to the People , we are The People . Let’s get inside . We have no representation. Make this day count and set a Precent about what the real voice of America sounds like . We are our own representation. This is why we are here today , to speak of 100’s of millions of Americans that have been betrayed .</p>

             <p> Amen. (Not Awoman) I was there. It was one of the strangest situations I have ever been in. My heart sincerely breaks for @AshliBabbitt and her family, friends and loved ones. My mind paints a picture of her in the arms of our Savior with one American flag draped around their shoulders. She fought for the country He so graciously gave us. She can finally rest.</p>

             <p> I was there. And yes Antifa was there posing as Trump supporters. They would turn their MAGA hats backwards to let the other Antifa members who they were. Most of the actual Trump supporters that made it in the capital just wanted their voices heard. There were comments that they let on BLM activists in on several occasions. For the number of people there all day was amazingly peaceful, upbeat, positive and patriotic. But the media isnt showing that. As it got dusk BLM small groups headed out to where people were waiting for charter busses and intentionally started some fist fights. But as soon as Pence made that statement people were angry and felt betrayed.</p>

             <p> Not true. This ii MSM misinformation. I was there. Proud boys were wearing all black to avoid police persecution. Those were good people. They simply made their voice heard after months of being ignored. No one was hurt. Nothing was damaged besides a window.The police killed that girl out of stupidity.</p>

             <p> @BillMedcalf I was there through it all. I saw zero weapons other than the weapons of the police. ZERO. Hell, even the Antifa infiltrators didn't openly carry weapons that I saw. So yes... We were armed withpaper signs, flags, and righteous anger. But if I were a DC cop, intent on framing the Trumpets, then I would be a little nervous and jumpy as well!

             <p> I was there at the capital on the 6th. The dems set us up. They played us perfectly. I didn’t see one person who wasn’t there to just support Trump. We will always be known as the people who attacked the capital. Dems could not let the American people see what scum they are and they won again. Most people will never know the truth. Money talks I’m saddened to see this. God is good. They had to destroy Trump</p>

             <p> The media and all the people in congress right now are lying about what happened. I was there and witnessed capital police attacking peaceful protesters repeatedly for no reason. We were yelling why are you doing this. I have never seen such unprofessional police in my life. They where spraying peaceful people in the face point blank range. Tear gas and dispersment rounds fired into the crowd right off the start. I witnessed an elderly man with a cain get hit in the head by a baton for no reason. He was bleeding from the side of his eye where they clobbered him. A husband and wife standing in the front the wife was sprayed point blank in the face for no reason. Many were attacked for no reason. It was crazy. It felt like a set up. It was disgusting. Now I'm listening to congress and representatives talk and blatantly lie about what happened.</p>

             <p> That’s simply not true. People like Lin Wood heated people up and they were angry. The Capitol was easily breached. Cops didn’t jus let people in. I was there. Stop spreading these lies. Go watch the videos if you do t believe me. All these democrats using this event against us was our own fault. The truth is though, this had to happen.</p>

             <p> I WAS THERE. I believe that the violence was perpetrated by FAKE infiltrators (there were quite a few). I am anguished that a military veteran is dead. I heard she had ANTIFA tattoos. I don't know what they look like, but it makes sense because Patriots don't break windows. ANTIFA does every time they riot. It is entirely possible that some TRUMP supporters served as useful idiots, following where the aided & abetted (by the Capital Police who granted them admittance to the Capital) riot instigating perpetrators led. I could be wrong. CCP News (Formerly loosely designated, FAKE News) is for damn sure wrong, and is using the tragic events to further stir, divide and separate Patriots from President TRUMP ~ (America 1.0's LAST PRESIDENT)</p>

             <p> I was there. It wasn’t a riot and no one felt unsafe or was worried about violence. Everyone outside was unaware of anything going on inside. When politicians go unchecked this is eventually what happens. When was the last time anyone in Washington went to jail? If just 1 politicians head would have rolled down those steps today the people would have been satisfied. They were asking the cops to stand down. They wanted the dirty politicians inside the building and I don’t blame them one bit. I was only on front steps and when police approached everyone backed down and allowed the police to set a line.</p>

             <p> Watch every second of this six minute video. An innocent, unarmed, Patriot, young woman, was murdered today by her nations capital police. I was there~ the police were disgusting for the entire time we were outside protesting. Shoving us, grabbing us, shooting at us with pepper spray, flash grenades, percussion grenades, and tear gas. They instigated this assault on the capital. We the people are fed up. No one has listened to our peaceful requests. So mote it be. #JohnnyBravo

             <p> Let me make this as clear as possible: the capital police fired the tear gas and percussion grenades and started pepper spraying us and physically shoving us FIRST! I know I was there ~ front and center~ and I was shoved by the police, grabbed by the police, and pepper sprayed for standing firm and telling them to join the people and start upholding their oath to uphold the constitution against enemies foreign and domestic!! The Capital Police started this! #wethepeople #JohnnyBravo</p>

             <p> I’m not saying there was no vandalism or violence from our side but I didn’t see any of it for the 8+ hours I was there. I did watch ANTIFA breaking windows at the Capitol and a group of Trump supporters tackled him in 30 seconds. #StopTheSteal</p>

             <p> They are 🚨 GASLIGHTING 🚨 the public to try and blacklist Trump from any future of the GOP. I was there at the doors of the Capitol and this was the extent of "violence" that occurred. The only true violence was from the Capitol Police murdering that woman.

             <p> The media is telling a false story. I was there for the entire event. Patriots didn't carry guns. The capital was broken into by Antifa with the help of the FBI. Trump supporters had no idea what was going on inside as we never got in. More propaganda from the deep state rats and rinos.</p>

             <p> I was there all day today, from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm. I stood in front of the Ellipse and listed to the speakers, culminating with the president. Then we all headed over to the Capital. It wa peaceful, happy and enthusiastic. On the way to the Capital we found out Pence betrayed us all. The reaction was head shaking, calling him a traitor, discussing what might happen next. No violence, at all. There were a handful of so-called Trump supporters who broke in to the Capital. The media will tell you it’s thousands. BS. Police were rolling in from all over the metro area. Most protesters were already leaving. We had to get on our buses, etc. I stopped at a food truck to get a pretzel on the way back, and cup of coffee because it was freaking cold out. But the police response was overblown for the threat. Big drama. If only they had responded that way to the BLM riots!</p>

             <p> Agree. I was there. This crowd was not your typical “political event” crowd. Hard working Americans who pay taxes and follow the law. They don’t cheat in life and they are mad that cheating has seemingly been allowed to win. Cheating should not win! Pay attention to the no longer silent majority. Do a 10 day forensic audit.</p>

             <p> The security was massive. The national guard was there since yesterday. Complete FAILURE by police, FBI, and national guard. Just like Washington. I know, I was there.</p>

             <p> I WAS THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, I was there to protest the fraudulent elections that happened in our country. Probably with a million people or so and it was AWSOME!!, and now because of a few who took the law into there own hands made all of us no different than the antifa or BLM thugs who burned cities down. Yes we stand for something better but to demonstrate the same way they do, NO WAY, we are better than that. Now, what could’ve been a day that was historic for a rally and possible overturning votes, now feels like overturning votes goes alongside lawlessness. NO!!! I have condemned the BLM and Antifa thugs because of there lawlessness and I won’t condone what happened today because it was backed by a better cause. WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT!!!</p>

             <p> I was there it wasn't a riot. A few broken windows compared to a city being burned down. And what happened today is being considered more wrong. This is total BS. #stopthesteal #removethechinacrats</p>

             <p> I was in Washington DC and saw first hand, Antifa/BLM people in the crowd start this run on the Capital. I was there to fight for the rights of the Arizona people in District 7 legally and peacefully. The unrest of the hundreds of people I spoke to want the voter fraud presented in a court of law. If a court truly hears the evidence and comes back that there is no evidence then We the People will accept the outcome. We have watched a lying FISA used to impeach an innocent President. A speaker of the house tear up the President’s speech. Dominion software changing Trump votes flipped to Biden but but no court is willing to even listen to any evidence. You wonder why 2 million people descended on Washington DC. Peaceful results are the republican way but if no answers are sought or given then this unrest will continue to grow. Please Congressman and Senators, please do the right thing for the right reasons. Give the people truthful information.</p>

             <p> Update, the DC March for TRUTH was in all respects peaceful. After Trump’s address 1,000,000 plus patriots took to the streets and walked to the White House, it was a sight to see! Detour in route to drop chairs in car and before we even made it up to hotel lobby from garage the “news” was widespread about violent Trump supporters! There was ZERO phone internet access and limited texting so how the hell can that be? False Flag? I do believe so, I was there.</p>

             <p> Part1: FIRST REPORT ON D.C. (I was there)<br>D.C. Report from what I witnessed first hand: (Notice: there are reports that "some" from Antifa infiltrated into Trump crowd. They may have insighted some/ most of bad acting) Initial report from my view and first hand accounts/ boots on ground: Trumps speech and rally was a great success @ ellipse. All peaceful and very polite attendees. Very peaceful rally.. Afterwards everyone marched from the ellipse to the capitol/ Congressional bldg. Once there "some" in crowd pushed down barriers and began advancing on capitol grounds. As crowd amassed teargas and flashbangs were used on crowd. (Back of capitol bldg) Crowd began to push up more toward steps of capitol bldg. More fashbangs (alot) and teargass were deployed against advances and crowd. ALL PEACEFUL PROTESTS. In waves more people advanced u</p>

             <p> @SeanHannity the protest at the capital building today was NOT a violent protest. 99.999% of the people there were exercising their rights as Americans to peacefully protest...men, women, and children. I know this because I was there.  The MSM will spin it to make true patriots look like criminals. When the “leftists” protest, they topple statues and burn down their fellow Americans’ businesses. True patriots go straight to the source of the problem, the elected officials.</p>

             <p> Every video clip/photo image in this montage was taken by me personally today (except the last image from the air). This was 100% a peaceful gathering of concerned American citizens. We did not loot, we did not burn, we did not even fight! We were showing love for our country. We went up to the capital because that was our house where we were met with violence and eventually bullets. The media is lying! There were not a few thousand people herr today there were just under 1 million! We were not violent! Do not form a negative opinion if you’re not here. 🇺🇸✌🏻</p>

             <p> I was there today in DC! Do not listen to any of the media calling us anything but awesome patriots! Antifa stormed the Capitol not patriots!</p>

             <p> This was antifa that instigated and led the charge. A bunch of foolish people followed them. This was calculated and organized. Watch the lame stream media and you'll see why they did it. I was there I saw 2 people instigating. I'm sure there were others. It was not Trump or his supporters. They used our frustration against us to shed a bad light on us.</p>

             <p> I was at the Capitol today. It was peaceful. But Patriots are really upset about losing our country to the communists. All we want is a fair, honest election... whatever the outcome.</p>
