            <a href='https://archive.vn/tl7JL' target='_blank'>USA Hackers</a> released a post claiming they found and leaked data after a hack on the Gates Foundation by the κατέχον militia. They subsequently made the claim that they hacked the CDC, NIH, World Bank and WHO.

          <p>
            Over the course of the domain's 10 year spread there are some notable points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hetzner Online GmbH first acquired usahackers.com in November of 2012, and have intermittently maintained ownership for approximately 6 years. I found that 102 domains are hosted on 178.63.49.153, and the majority belong to <a href='https://archive.is/wg8HE' target='_blank'>BEZH</a>, a company that specializes in Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality, Bichip, etc. Microsoft Corporation is also found on the USA Hackers domain IP list (104.46.97.80, 3 months), which is interesting because BEZH is an official partner of Microsoft Denmark.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 2013 to 2015 there are many archived pages <a href='https://archive.is/0mZ3s' target='_blank'>1</a>, <a href='https://archive.is/PkVNO' target='_blank'>2</a>, <a href='https://archive.is/PkVNO' target='_blank'>3</a>, <a href='https://archive.is/SsUPT' target='_blank'>4</a>,  <a href='https://archive.is/vXzsC' target='_blank'>5</a>) belonging to USA Hackers, and in the footer of each page there are a variety of phone numbers belonging to different countries. The number 45.4241.7244 is featured frequently, which belongs to <a href='https://archive.is/qBfgL' target='_blank'>S. Enjavi</a> from BlueAlert, a company that <a href='https://archive.is/0c6kA' target='_blank'>acquired BEZH</a> in early 2016. There are also copyrights that mention BEZH and a common footnote, 'The American Hackers Club,' which is also mentioned on the USA Hackers social media.
          </p>
          <div class='center border'><img src='images/ahc.png' class="med" alt='The American Hackers Club' /></div>
          <p>
            A <a href='images/dancode.png' target='_blank'>screenshot</a> I captured from September 2018 reveals a connection between 'Dan Learning' and 'AMERICAN HACKERS CLUB' via the highlighted tooltip in the source code. This image linked to none other than usahackers.com.

          </div>

          <p>
            Getting back to USA Hackers content, I noticed that upon further inspection of their file directories, it was clear that they modified the folder structure and post dates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Folders dated <a href='https://archive.is/LNL45' target='_blank'>02/2011</a>, <a href='https://archive.is/YCrhL' target='_blank'>11/2014</a>, <a href='https://archive.is/qk5Iv' target='_blank'>12/2018</a>, and <a href='https://archive.is/oIJ2c' target='_blank'>11/2019</a> contain files that were uploaded 12/2019, which is the same month and year that the domain was transferred.
          </p>
          <p>
            And though one could argue that if you were doing a transfer there might be a need to modify the post date. I could find no evidence that the articles existed prior to the date of upload. Unless you consider the possibility that they come from other sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their article titled, '<a href='https://archive.vn/qu6iW' target='_blank'>US military Knew about coronavirus</a>' was <a href='https://archive.is/lAKZ7' target='_blank'>posted on April 02, 2020 at 01:24PM</a>. But the content in this post is identical to other sites, <a href='https://archive.vn/108nn' target='_blank'>one of which</a> was posted at 1:14AM, and yet there is no mention of an alternate original source.
          </p>
          <p>
            On December 09, 2019 USA Hackers posted '<a href='https://archive.is/sDm76' target='_blank'>All leaked documents on Assad chemical attack</a>,' a plagiarization of an article by <a href='https://archive.is/uhuhv' target='_blank'>World Socialist Web Site</a>. USA Hackers removed every WikiLeaks mention that was originally found in the WSWS post.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            WikiLeaks also published the first draft of the interim FFM report, which noted that the investigators were “unable to provide satisfactory explanations for the relatively moderate damage to the cylinders allegedly dropped from an unknown height, compared to the destruction caused to the rebar-reinforced roofs.” This fact--that the evidence did not point to the cylinders being dropped from Assad’s aircraft--was excluded from the final report.
            <div class='caption'>World Socialist Web Site</div>

          <p>
            In an article titled, '<a href='https://archive.vn/Osjve' target='_blank'>CIA Secret datacenters</a>,' dated 09/2019 but actually <a href='https://archive.is/4BrKF' target='_blank'>published 12/2019</a>, they have, once again, taken content <a href='https://archive.is/ouP7d' target='_blank'>sourced from WikiLeaks</a> and removed all connections to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the more obvious mistakes they made was not changing European spellings. Words like 'realise' or 'centralised' are not common in America and did not appear to be part of their typical writing style.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another <a href='https://archive.vn/ipx47' target='_blank'>WikiLeaks article</a> that was modified without credit was titled, '<a href='https://archive.vn/NGB5N' target='_blank'>OPCW-DOUMA</a>,' in which they went so far as to take credit for the release.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            WikiLeaks is also releasing the original preliminary report for the first time along with the redacted version (that was released by the OPCW) for comparison.
            <div class='caption'>WikiLeaks</div>

            Finally, in a post titled, '<a href='https://archive.is/Vbjn7' target='_blank'>Secure your WordPress</a>,' dated 10/2017, but posted 12/2019, they've copied author <a href='https://archive.is/FSoRA' target='_blank'>Eric Sizemore</a> verbatim, leaving out only a few sentences.
          </p>
          <h3>Wrap it up</h3>
          <p>
            So the questions have to be asked - is USA Hackers just a copycat group trying to cash in? What does a company from Denmark, invested in chip implants, stand to gain by purporting to be an American hacker group?
          </p>
          <p>
            Posts by USA Hackers made their rounds on social media immediately after release. <a href='https://medium.com/@th3r0wdy/big-breaking-who-wuhan-institute-of-virology-and-gates-foundation-have-been-hacked-8f4e6fa7864f' target='_blank'>Articles were written</a> about this 'huge leak' and yet their credibility never checked. Littering content with uncertainties for a few claps does not absolve you from dumping garbage all over the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to honestly ask ourselves, at what point did being the first to post become more important than being the first to post the truth? The path to personal development does not require the sacrifice of values. If you absolve yourself from due diligence you are part of the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Lynda M. Martin wrote in '<a href='https://soapboxie.com/social-issues/What-has-happened-to-truth-in-journalism' target='_blank'>What Has Happened to Truth in Journalism?</a>':
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            I should expect certain neutrality and an obsession with the truth proven through facts from my news sources. I shouldn’t have to go to so many sources to get the full picture. I shouldn’t have to research beyond the story to find the truth.
            <br /><br />
            And we the readers, or at least those of us with intelligence enough to want the truth (the whole truth and nothing but the truth) should rise up in anger at such a question, demanding you do the job you’re paid to do, that you should have been doing all along.
