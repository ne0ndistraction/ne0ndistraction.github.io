            A movement that has gained quite a following over the last few years is Q Anon, a far-right conspiracy theory against the 'deep state' based on the 4chan posts of 'Q,' who claimed to be a high ranking official within the government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently I discovered a huge network of domains that one would not ordinarily assume were related. I found these after looking into USA Hackers, as they have the same domain IP Address: 185.165.168.35. So I'm going to do a breakdown of how all of what you see above, and more, is connected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a complete list of URLs I'll be going over, with archived links, if available, for reference:

            The following is a list of IP Addresses which includes each domain and the date that domain was last seen, the latest being my date last checked, connected to that IP.

            Not only do these domains share the same IP addresses and change dates, many of them also use the same <a href='images/122935375.png' target='_blank'>Google Analytics ID</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>UA-122935375</h3>

          </ul>
          <p>
            The primary theme these sites use is the <a href='https://wpastra.com/' target='_blank'>Astra Wordpress Theme</a>, and much of their contact information is either fake or missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's worth pointing out that a company called Global Menu Solutions is also tied to the same IP and UA code. They deal in food, particularly seafood, and have filings in several locations around the world, including Thailand. But I believe there's a lot more to that story, as I've found a link between Joe Fuda, Director of Asian Operations at GMS, and the Panama Papers via <a href='https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/12132339' target='_blank'>Offshore Leaks</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>555 Change is Coming</h3>
          <div>
            On the contact page they state their location as Temecula, CA and have an email address that is different than the domain itself: freedomrides@<strong>changeiscoming.com</strong>. This domain is tied to the Facebook account <a href='https://archive.is/CusTG' target='_blank'>Taga Pulo Ka Pag Kilala Mo Mo Corrupt Sa Brgy 8</a>, which translates loosely to, 'You know corruption in Brgy 8.' It is also found on the Twitter account <a href='https://archive.is/ecwzn' target='_blank'>@AlvelaEnrique</a>, which uses the display name 'presD30,' a reference to President Duerte from the Philippines. This connection between 'changeiscoming.com' and Duerte can also be seen on the <a href='https://archive.is/gFOAL' target='_blank'>Dash Signs</a> website, in a sample banner.
          </div>
          <p>
            The 555 blog is only one post about free speech, in which one can deduce they lean right, as they've stated, '555 participants are very likely to disagree with our more liberal friends.' They have a members only section but a search of pages reveals an incomplete member registration page. Every page you visit prompts you to share via various social networks, but all of the links are broken. I did, however, find them on social media under the name <a href='https://archive.is/taOze' target='_blank'>@555changeiscom1</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            While there are no tweets by this user, there is a connection to <a href='https://archive.is/taOze' target='_blank'>@MedicineTrekker</a>, who follows this account, which is a domain linked above. <a href='https://archive.is/GM73u' target='_blank'>@prayingmedic</a> is another follower, but I won't delve too deep into this connection, as it warrants it's own post.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than various political persons, including Donald Trump, the only other accounts 555 is following are his 2 followers.
          </p>
          <h3>Chhota Lund & Super Chub Club</h3>
          <div>
            I'm going to group these together because Chhota Lund is part of the Super Chub Club network.
          </div>
          <p>
            Chhota Lund advertises a product called FatterWood, which I suspect is supposed to improve the penis size of Indian men. It's hard to say though, because all content on this site is <a href='http://lipsum.com/' target='_blank'>Lorem Ipsum</a>, dummy text, and even the product shots are blank. The page titled 'The Science' is a bogus Javascript course advertisement, and their 'Testimonials' are intended for the course. The social network links do not work, neither do the 'Choose a plan' buttons, and their address is listed as 23 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10160, USA, which is an address found on the Astra 'Ready to Import' templates page under the name eCourse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Super Chub Club is similar, though aimed at American men:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Social conditioning including exposure to feminazis, political correctness, soy lattes and 24 hour porn-on-demand have made men soft, both above the belt and below.
            <br /><br />
            This is the reality of today. The fall of the modern western male. Welcome to America's weakest generation. If you're feeling a little like Bruce Jenner, then it's time to grow a pair. Don't let this happen to you!
            <br /><br />
            In today's perverse world of beta-cucks, soyboys, SJWs and 'gender fluidity', it's time to take back your manhood... NOW!
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Their address is listed as '30 North Gould St. Suite R Sheridan, WY 82801,' which belongs to a registration agent company. In the footer there is another connection via a line that states, 'Super Chub Club® and FatterWood® are trademarks of Garner Hoffman Holdings, LLC.'
          </p>
          <h3>Garner Hoffman Holdings</h3>
          <div>
            Like the other sites, GHH uses Astra, and the site is a placeholder. GHH is <a href='https://archive.vn/rq4IV' target='_blank'>registered as a limited liability corporation</a> in Wyoming, with an incorporation date of Apr 25 2018.
          </div>
          <p>
            Garner Hoffman also runs a website called <a href='https://archive.is/X2ele' target='_blank'>Crilastate</a>, which uses the same IP address and analytics code. The site offers a product for prostate health called Crila. There are two contact locations, Vietnam and Wyoming. The Wyoming phone number is <a href='images/coltonphone.png' target='_blank'>909-430-1615</a>, which also happens to be a Colton, CA phone number.
          </p>
          <h3>IMPECCABLE 45</h3>
          <div>
            This is a pro-Trump site, featuring the MAGA, Make America Great Again, mantra. The top navigation links include 'Politics of Poverty,' which is a connected domain listed above. The writer of the site is named theRoguePatriot. This author's e-mail is displayed as roguepatriot@<strong>theroguebohemian</strong>.com, which is yet another domain we've linked together. Naturally, this site features a shop selling MAGA gear.
          </div>
          <p>
            Though likely unrelated, the editor of this site, theRoguePatriot, is a moniker originally belonging to Florida resident Geoff Ross, currently running for County Commissioner District 1 in Santa Rosa County, Florida. He is the President of The Rogue Patriot Group and helped organize the US Constitution and Freedom Rally many years back.
          </p>
          <h3>MedicineTrekker</h3>
          <div>
            While the current home page for MedicineTrekker is a placeholder, I did find an archive of the <a href='https://archive.is/3NKFq' target='_blank'>old site</a>. There are also filings for <a href='https://archive.is/IgYX3' target='_blank'>Medicine Trekker Media Productions, LLC</a> done via a registered agent in New Mexico. The head office address for this company is No. 19/1 & 19/2 I Main 2nd Phase Bangalore, NA - 560 058, which belongs to Sami Labs Limited.
          </div>
          <p>
            Visiting the <a href='https://archive.vn/LpxEY' target='_blank'>@MedicineTrekker</a> account on Twitter provided the connection to 'qmovement' and Q Anon. The majority of their tweets are simultaneously pushing Zinc and the 'qmovement' site. They have also <a href='https://archive.is/Hgihc' target='_blank'>linked to 'theroguebohemian.com'</a> via Twitter.
          </p>
          <p>
            In one tweet they made <a href='https://archive.is/E0IY5' target='_blank'>derogatory comments</a> about liberals, which seems unbefitting of a professional company and more like the rants of an individual, despite the above corporate filing connection to a leading herbal supplement manufacturer in India.
          </p>
          <p>
            A photo tweeted by MedicineTrekker reveals his name to be <a href='https://archive.is/bvtBj' target='_blank' class='blackout'>Mitchell</a>, which also happens to be the owner of an account on Freelancer, where I found a number of requests for work related to GHH and their properties.
          </p>
          <div class='center border'><img src='images/45shirt.png' alt='IMPEACH/IMPECCABLE' /></div>
          <ul>
            <li><a href='images/shirtdesign.png' target='_blank'>T-Shirt Design</a>: They provided the above 'IMPEACH 45' shirt and requested a similar design with a word change. It is logical to assume the word change was IMPECCABLE, considering the domain connection.</li>
            <li><a href='https://archive.vn/1XD2r' target='_blank'>Super Chub Club Logos</a>: Mentions the 'GrowNads' and 'FatterWood' logos. The 'Other jobs from this employer' column contains a reference to MedicineTrekker.</li>
            <li><a href='images/dtclogo.png' target='_blank'>Dollar Tube Club Logo</a>: Same location and number of projects.</li>
            <li><a href='images/dtcsite.png' target='_blank'>Dollar Tube Club Site</a>: In an RSS site search I found a <a href='https://archive.vn/Nam8U' target='_blank'>connection to Nutramedica</a>.</li>
            <li><a href='https://archive.vn/gcEbB' target='_blank'>Email Signature</a>: Says his name is <span class='blackout'>Mitchell</span> and his location is <span class='blackout'>Dist. 3 in Ho Chi Minh City</span>, Vietnam, with the phone number <span class='blackout'>093 2069475</span>. Again, MedicineTrekker listed as another job from this person.</li>
            <li><a href='https://archive.vn/8Xx2W' target='_blank'>MedicineTrekker Site</a>: Another request for the site design can be found <a href='https://archive.is/oLPrm' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>
            <li><a href='https://archive.vn/NBFem' target='_blank'>Nutramedica</a>: This profile page displays the same location, Klongtoey, Bangkok, Thailand.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Nutramedica</h3>
          <div>
            A search for <span class='blackout'>Mitchell</span> + nutramedica <a href='https://archive.is/osg3L' target='_blank'>revealed</a> the name <span class='blackout'>Mitchell Chavez</span> from <span class='blackout'>Colton, California</span>. I also <a href='images/mitch.png' target='_blank'>found a forum post</a> that mentioned his full name with Nutramedica Consultants.
          </div>
          <p>
            Clustrmaps provides <a href='https://archive.is/8A3Vp' target='_blank'>two email addresses</a> for <span class='blackout'>Mitchell</span>: <span class='blackout'>grgrasputn</span>@aol.com, <span class='blackout'>grgrasputn</span>@bright.net.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're wondering about the email username, it's possibly a reference to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin' target='_blank'>Grigori Rasputin</a>, also known as the 'Mad Monk,' a Russian holy man, or con man, depending on who you ask.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class='blackout'>Mitchell Chavez</span> is also listed as an owner in a <a href='https://viewdns.info/reversewhois' target='_blank'>Reverse Whois Lookup</a> for 4 domains:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>fatterwood.com</li>
            <li>hoasf.org</li>
            <li>vietnamrising.com</li>
            <li>whitekidswithoutipads.org</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Searching <span class='blackout'>nutramedica</span>@icloud.com, the email listed on person report above, links to 3 of those domains as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing the search for <span class='blackout'>Mitchell Chavez</span> led me to Sami Direct, an MLM 'nutraceudical' company, on which <span class='blackout'>Mitchell</span> is listed as Dr. <span class='blackout'>Mitchell Chavez</span>, ND, CNC, Research & Procurement Specialist. Not only do <a href='https://archive.is/d71Jv' target='_blank'>photos of <span class='blackout'>Mitchell</span></a> on the Sami Direct site show him to be the same person as MedicineTrekker, MedicineTrekker follows the @samidirect account, and in the above corporation filings Sami Labs is Sami Direct.

          <h3>Passive Prostitution</h3>
          <div>
            This site is essentially a landing page with a notify form, but it does mention the name 'theRogue Bohemian.' The video, which is not displayed in the archive link above, is a video titled 'CRAZY KPOP PORN GAME.' It was posted by a user named <a href='https://archive.is/Xj18a' target='_blank'>Vlad Bala</a>, and if you visit his profile, you might recognize the Anonymous logo in the header image.
          </div>
          <h3>Politics of Poverty</h3>
          <div>
            There is no official website or archive for this domain, however, I was able to find a Twitter account associated with it under the name, <a href='https://archive.is/JqWrH' target='_blank'>@PoliticsPoverty</a>. Not only does it feature the URL match, it also has the location Bangkok, Thailand.
          </div>
          <h3>Q Movement</h3>
          <div>
            This site setup is largely the same as Passive Prostitution - they utilize the same theme, form, etc. At the bottom right of the page is a paypal donation link which is setup under the name Garner Hoffman (Garner Hoffman Holdings, LLC).
          </div>
          <p>
            Once you fill out the sign up form, which I would not advise, you are taken to <a href='images/qmovement-complete.png' target='_blank'>another page</a> with information about the documentary they are releasing, or so they say, over the summer. There is also a paypal link to make a donation to support the plan/documentary that also goes back to Garner Hoffman.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clicking on the Plandemic image takes you to the <a href='images/qmovement-signup.png' target='_blank'>'official' documentary page</a> on the Q Movement site. None of the social links work and there is another form, which makes zero sense because in order to get to this page, unless you know the <a href='https://qmovement.io/plandemic-movie/' target='_blank' class='warning'>URL</a>, you would have had to sign up already.
          </p>
          <div class='center'>
            <img src='images/plandemic.jpg' alt='Mitchell Chavez' />
            <div class='caption'>Plandemic: An upcoming documentary supposedly exposing Dr. Fauci</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The film this site is referencing was made by Mikki Willis of <a href='http://elevate.us/' target='_blank'>Elevate</a>. As far as I can tell there is no connection between Mikki and Q Movement and I have not yet received a confirmation from anyone at Elevate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal disclaimer on this page references The Rogue Bohemian, 'QMovement, its Editor-in-Chief 'tRB' and staff, are in no way providing medical advice or suggestions of any kind whatsoever.'
          </p>
          <p>
            I signed up anyway and received access to a <a href='https://archive.is/Ibd3C' target='_blank'>newsletter archive on Dropbox</a>, which featured PDFs on a variety of topics including Q, COVID-19, and 9/11.
          </p>
          <p>
            Browsing their <a href='https://archive.is/uBT44' target='_blank'>directories</a> reveals a bit more content than what we see when first coming to the page, including a video titled, 'Best is Yet to Come Trump 2020,' by a now suspended Twitter handle by the name <a href='https://archive.is/vEmWT' target='_blank'>@StormIsUponUs</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the <a href='https://archive.is/qSi3B' target='_blank'>Q Movement Youtube Channel</a> there are several videos featuring someone recording a video of themselves watching a video, like it's the year 2000, within a Vietnamese app. These videos have also been added as screenshots to one of the PDFs titled 'MADE-IN-CHINA.'
          </p>
          <p>
            In their newsletter 'Does Digital Privacy Interest You?' they put out feelers for an annual subscription for their current subscribers which comes with a laundry list of features, but ultimately is just an email address at an offshore domain/host, all for the small cost of $149/year. No thanks.
          </p>

            If you are interested in these newsletters I've saved them as printed PDFs, removing any links/scripts, and you can view/download them here, with their original titles, as much as it pained me to leave them in tact:
          </p>

          <div>
            This is another sign up landing page, using the same form and base template. The Rogue Bohemian site actually contains the <a href='https://archive.vn/t4DKR' target='_blank'>Passive Prostitution</a> and the <a href='https://archive.vn/BvKDl' target='_blank'>Q Movement</a> sites within itself. This could be due to Wordpress Multisite functionality.

            The copyright in the footer of the site says, 'American Freethinkers Guild,' which is also mentioned in some capacity by <a href='images/freethinkers.png' target='_blank'>MedicineTrekker</a> on Twitter.

            There is one person at the center of this particular group of domains: <strong><span class='blackout'>Mitchell Chavez</span></strong>.
          </div>
          <p>
            He has made a career out of peddling natural medicine all over the world through MLM companies, and has a tendency to start businesses that never amount to much but always include a way to purchase something or donate money. He has taken Q followers under his wing and he has parroted information about the coronavirus pandemic, often without validating its credibility. Add to that his push of supplements, requests for donations, absurd 'privacy protected' email costs, and potential copyright infringement, and it becomes clear why I was suspicious in the first place.
