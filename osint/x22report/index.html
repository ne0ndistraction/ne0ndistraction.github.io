          <img src='images/main.png' class='header' />
          <p>
            For 10 years Dave from X22Report has faithfully reported on the impending economic collapse of our country, and his dedicated followers, blinded with admiration,
            could not even be bothered question his credentials.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of Sep 2020, X22Report had 47k BitChute subscribers, nearly 422k Twitter followers, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200925153337if_/http://youtube.com/user/X22Report" target="_blank">923k YouTube subscribers</a>. His podcast is featured on most QAnon related sites and podcast platforms. His website gets about 15k estimated pageviews per day, but his YouTube channel is where most go to get updated content. His videos on YouTube have over 267m views, averaging somewhere around 8m-12m views per month, with an earning potential of $485k to $2.4m ($688k avg) annually. <a href="https://archive.is/JR2PZ" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="https://archive.is/LXmRn" target="_blank">[2]</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            His Twitter, YouTube, and PayPal accounts have all been <a href="https://archive.is/d0vPz" target="_blank">suspended</a> but that hasn't deterred him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today he has <a href="https://archive.is/LY8kt" target="_blank">137k BitChute subscribers</a>, up 37k from <a href="https://archive.is/3q2Eh" target="_blank">last month</a>. His rumble account has <a href="https://archive.is/ZxJtu" target="_blank">228k followers</a>, up 166k from the <a href="https://archive.is/U6kBq" target="_blank">last two months</a>. His Telegram account has nearly <a href="https://archive.is/QAZfe" target="_blank">19k members</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>So who is Dave?</h3>
            From X22Report's about page:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Dave’s Bio: I am 54 years old and I have children. I lived in NY and I was there for 911 and the North East blackout.  I lost my job in 2008 and was laid off. Since 2008 I have been prepping. My wife, kids and I try to eat organic and we try to avoid all chemicals in foods. We make our own bread, food and pizza from scratch. I have a technology background and have worked for large financial institutions.  My main job was securing the systems from viruses and hackers and maintaining the trading systems so the money flowed from system to system.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            A step back in time, to <a href='https://archive.is/ojP2Q' target='_blank'>Nov 2013</a>, reveals a slightly more informative paragraph which will be used for the eventual confirmation of identity.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Dave’s Bio: I am 47 years old and I have 4 kids. They are 12, 12, 12, and 11.  Yes I have triplets and another a year later. I lived in NY and I was there for 911 and the North East blackout.  I lost my job in 2008 and was laid off. Since 2008 I have been prepping.

The site <a href='images/newz.png' target='_blank'>NewzSentinel</a>, which resembles X22Report, and <a href='https://archive.is/SKFZC' target='_blank'>The People's Newz</a> also used that analytics ID.

          </ul>
          <p>
            I also found a <a href='https://archive.is/lG6eq' target='_blank'>development site</a> belonging to X22Report. This gave me the username: <span class='blackout'>fishmand65</span>. It is never a good idea to attach any significant date to your username. In Dave's case, 65 is a reference to the year of his birth, 1965.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that username I was able to find an <a href='https://archive.is/Odypz' target='_blank'>archived whois</a> for X22Report registered to the email <span class='blackout'>fishmand65@yahoo.com</span> and name <span class='blackout'><strong>David Fishman</strong></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also connected to this email address is the domain <a href='https://archive.is/hZLoB' target='_blank'>fishmanreporting.com</a>. The address listed is <span class='blackout'>23 Mark Twain, Carmel NY</span>, but this address does not exist. It is actually a combination of 2 previous addresses, <span class='blackout'>23 Mark Twain Dr, Morristown, NJ</span> and <span class='blackout'>54 Sparrow Ridge Rd, Carmel, NY</span>, belonging to <span class='blackout'>David Marc Fishman</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            An in depth look at his <a href='https://archive.is/xDGy0' target='_blank'>profile</a> allowed the discovery of his <a href='https://archive.is/DvGDa' target='_blank' class='blackout'>Instagram</a> account, and his wife's Facebook page, where I was able to confirm that this Dave has triplets with a 4th child a year later. It also gives us a ton of e-mail addresses with the following domains:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>mailordermommy.com (not what it sounds like)</li>
            <li>totallyfab.com</li>
            <li>myeeda.com</li>
            <li>howtopcguru.com</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Of the domains on that list, the most important would be howtopcguru.com, as it might give us insight into his security background within financial institutions, as he mentioned on his about page.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reality, <a href='https://archive.is/tIeEo' target='_blank'>this page</a> is a disappointment. It is a poorly written advertisement for a free, 133 page eBook. All you have to do is give him your email address.

            Can an anti-virus application fight against spyware, adware, hacker attacks, information loss, information theft, identity theft and wireless security?
            <br /><br />
            ABSOLUTELY NOT
            <br /><br />
            So do you really believe that you are protected against threats on the internet.<br />
            Think about this, someone can take your bank account number, passwords, files etc off of your pc and you would never know it. Have you ever had a pop-up that you couldn't get rid of. This is called adware, adware was probably installed on your pc without you even knowing it. Let me tell you how I am going to help you close virtually all security holes on your your PC and keep you up to date on security issues.

            These articles are missing punctuation, have words spelled incorrectly, and end abruptly. There is a list of over 100 <a href='https://ezinearticles.com/expert/David_Fishman/12802' target='_blank'>Ezine articles</a> that Dave has written, but most are related to Real Estate and Marketing. Of the ~10 articles related to Computers and Technology, half are about speeding up a slow computer and only <a href='https://ezinearticles.com/?Is-My-PC-Vulnerable-on-the-Internet?&id=63110' target='_blank'>one</a> is about PC security, and it's using the same copy from the howtopcguru.com site above. There is also only <a href='https://ezinearticles.com/?Need-Help-With-Bad-Credit&id=431812' target='_blank'>one</a> article about Finance. Seems strange coming from someone so knowledgeable about the economy.

          <h3>Wrap it up</h3>
          <p>
            Ultimately our path has led to the front door of a link farmer who appears to have successfully found his niche, taking up residence in <a href="https://archive.is/E0ZYw" target="_blank">Florida</a>, upgrading last year to a 6 bedroom home worth nearly $1M. Dave has mastered the art of catering to conservatives. He stokes his listeners fear of financial collapse while lining his pockets, never experiencing that same fear himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if that wasn't enough to convince his followers that he does not have their best interests at heart, how about the fact that up until his <a href="https://www.floridaresidentsdirectory.com/person/117621033/fishman-david" target="_blank">recent move</a> in which he has removed his political affiliation, he's been <a href="https://archive.is/hpJa8" target="_blank">registered as a Democrat</a>?
          </p>
          <p class="center">
            <img src="images/voter.png" class="med" />
          </p>
          <p>
            To quote Dave from one of his many articles:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            There is a lot of money to be made this way. Think of a well defined focused market that is niche based, this is what you should go after.
