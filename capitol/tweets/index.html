                We all know why Mitch McConnell doesn’t want an objection to the electoral college vote in the Senate on January 6th— because he obviously wants Trump out of office but doesn’t want to be held accountable for it by going on the record with a public vote.

                Stop the Steal launched the idea for #JAN6 and then POTUS endorsed just three days later! We now have information on hotels, speakers, carpools, caravans, buses, our map. Text JAN6 to 86184 for security alerts and http://WildProtest.com   🇺🇸  @realDonaldTrump SHARE THIS LINK <br /><br />
                  We are the OFFICIAL #StopTheSteal group (@StopTheStealUS). No guilt trip emails, spammy texts or fake bus tours. We're not even a group. We're 150 groups and activists working with one another. We built the #DoNotCertify hashtag and caucus, working with Congressmen. Join us! <br /><br />
                  The purpose behind #JAN6 was in 3 conversations I had with @DrPaulGosar, @RepMoBrooks, and @EagleEdMartin. We want REPUBLICANS in the House and Senate to feel the base breathing down their necks. We want them to know we won't forget who will #FightForTrump and won't. 2022.

                Yes Sir. It’s time to fight. There’s no cost too high in this battle. Patriots don’t need pampering and reimbursements. God will take care of His own. I’ll go broke saving this Nation and proclaiming the Gospel.

                Time for Republican Senators to step up and fight for the Presidency, like the Democrats would do if they had actually won. The proof is irrefutable! Massive late night mail-in ballot drops in swing states, stuffing the ballot boxes (on video), double voters, dead voters,<br /><br />
                  ...fake signatures, illegal immigrant voters, banned Republican vote watchers, MORE VOTES THAN ACTUAL VOTERS (check out Detroit & Philadelphia), and much more. The numbers are far greater than what is necessary to win the individual swing states, and cannot even be contested....<br /><br />
                  ....Courts are bad, the FBI and “Justice” didn’t do their job, and the United States Election System looks like that of a third world country. Freedom of the press has been gone for a long time, it is Fake News, and now we have Big Tech (with Section 230) to deal with....<br /><br />
                  ....But when it is all over, and this period of time becomes just another ugly chapter in our Country’s history, WE WILL WIN!!!

                I have always appreciated Vice President Mike Pence. He’s been a principled man on many issues. However, If he rolls over against Trump to save his own career, he will be the resurrection of Benedict Arnold. The fraud is too obvious to ignore.

                If you need a bus ride to DC, go to http://stopthesteal.us/bus  to fill out a form for select cities. Do this ASAP. Buses will leave early in the morning on Jan. 6 and they will arrive in DC before 9AM. You will leave DC and return to your home city that same day at around 10PM.

                Today and tomorrow will determine the next 30 years of our country. Will we allow this country to be taken over by powerful elites looking to infringe upon our constitutional rights? Or are WE GOING TO FIGHT BACK?

                Proud boy leader Enrique is a friend of mine. He’s always treated me with kindness and respect. It’s sad to hear that he was arrested for burning a BLM flag. BLM can burn down cities and businesses w/o paying the price. Heaven forbid someone burns their flag. #FreeEnrique

                House evacuation complete (as far as I know). Safe. Evacuation hurried but otherwise orderly. Heard loud shouting echoing down Capitol halls during evacuation. Thank Capitol Police! As House evacuated, Capitol Police ran to where we had just left. Waiting further instructions.

                MSM is trying to make it sound like the patriots are out there with tanks and guns. The woman who got shot was shot by the police. I am praying for her, but this narrative being spewed by MSM is disgusting.

                I pray that law enforcement continues to use great strength and confidence in restoring law and order across Washington. In the great words of Abraham Lincoln, “A house divided against itself, cannot stand.". We must unite together, as Americans.

                Here’s what I see happening - a million or more people gathered in our nations capital today to make a stand toward election integrity in our republic. Some rabble rousers (affiliation at this point unknown) breached the barricades and overtook a very small amount (cont)<br /><br />
                  of security to storm the Capitol as deliberation was ongoing. Every political representative in our country was convened inside and they had tiny amounts of security to stop this. Interesting given how many people were there. (Cont)<br /><br />
                  hose people got in and caused undo amounts of chaos. The million people outside stood outside the Capitol - AS IS THEIR RIGHT - to protest a government gone rogue.<br /><br />
                  Now all of them are yelling at everyone to stop exercising their rights and leave and screaming about how abhorrent it is that they DARE BE UPSET that we’ve fundamentally lost our system of government to power hungry tyrants<br /><br />
                  They are singing songs and standing at the steps of the Capitol. There were a small amount who got in, but the rest were peacefully protesting a stolen federal election.<br /><br />
                  Politicians- you have stomped all over the American people for decades, only ramping up these past few years. You don’t follow the rule of law, you’ve corrupted our judicial system, effected a coup on our duly elected President, and done it all while stealing our tax dollars<br /><br />
                  and sending billions of them to help countries overseas. The people are ANGRY and they have every right to show you that through peaceful protest.<br /><br />
                  Stop telling Americans to “go home”. Lots of us are finished taking orders from you, you are not kings, and we are your boss. It’s our country, and if people want to stand in DC en masse to scream that - they will. No stores looted. No burning fires - just pissed off Americans<br /><br />
                  This election was stolen from the American people. Poor you for feeling the pressure of going along with it. And that goes for you blue checkmarks too. No one tells me “stop”.

                Peaceful protests are the hallmark of our constitutional republic. Violence should never be tolerated, and I condemn the violence we experienced at the U.S. Capitol today. Those who have violently violated the laws should be prosecuted to the fullest extent.<br /><br />
                Thank you to the Capitol Police, National Guard, and other members of our law enforcement for their efforts to protect Members of Congress and our staff. I also thank the members of Arizona's law enforcement who remain vigilant during this time.

                Please, don’t be like #FakeNewsMedia, don’t rush to judgment on assault on Capitol. Wait for investigation. All may not be (and likely is not) what appears. Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics. Evidence follows:<br /><br />
                1. A Congressman warned me on MONDAY of a growing ANTIFA threat & advised that I sleep in my office rather than leaving Capitol complex & sleeping in my condo. I heeded that advice & have slept on office floor for 4 straight nights.<br /><br />
                2. Congressman told me he was warned on TUESDAY by Capitol Police officer that intelligence suggested fascist ANTIFA was going to try to infiltrate the Trump rally by dressing like Trump supporters.<br /><br />
                3. Capitol Police advised TUESDAY that it best not to leave Capitol complex.<br /><br />
                4. Evidence, much public, surfacing that many Capitol assaulters were fascist ANTIFAs, not Trump supporters.<br /><br />
                Again, time will reveal truth. Don’t rush to judgment. Don’t be fooled by #FakeNewsMedia whose political judgment drives their reporting. My view: fully prosecute all!

Yesterday their efforts were hijacked by a handful of idiots. Everyone who caused damaged to the Capitol yesterday should be prosecuted.<br /><br />
                It’s a real shame. We were so close! Over 140 house members and well over a dozen senators heard the calls and concerns of Americans who thought this election was rigged. They stepped up and joined the fight. But the actions of IDIOTS yesterday killed their efforts.

                I believe two can play the “mostly peaceful protest” game. Nothing was burned down, businesses weren’t looted or destroyed. Almost the entire day was a million Patriots, dancing, waving flags, singing, and just talking to eachother. The media does not want you to know that.🇺🇸

                This liberal blue check thinks I should be arrested for inciting a riot...for being a Trump supporter. You see where the Left is going with this? They threatened before that they would come after us if they ever had power. So much “love and tolerance.” @HughesHageman

                Stop saying “if they were black”. We know what would’ve happened if they were black. The mayor of DC would’ve told police to stand down and allow BLM in. BLM and Antifa would’ve set the Capitol on fire. They would’ve killed a few people, and it would’ve been called peaceful.
