                Start embracing this wave of new passionate conservatism. The establishment’s weak, laid back crap conservatism is why we now have the radical left who thinks they can burn buildings down and wage war on our police. No more quiet Mr. nice guy. It’s time to take the country back

                The American Left is seemingly unable to understand that other countries who’ve lost their rights to tyrannical governments never VOTED for that. They were deceived. They were tricked through false promises of free stuff. They will do the same to us here if we let them.

                  For the first time in my life I feel sorry for Donald Trump. He is standing up to his waist in snakes. Trust Rudy and Sidney only.

                  You are correct, they are. The White House legal team seem like scheming mediocrities worrying about not getting invited to the right parties unless they convince Trump to concede. Surrender -monkeys. Rudy and his people are strong. SIDNEY and flynn are fighters.

                  There is no hundred percent. There is 50 to 70%, and that is if the president signs the correct order. Which means he needs to stop listening to his own legal team which is disloyal.

                  Stop the Steal launched the idea for #JAN6 and then POTUS endorsed just three days later! We now have information on hotels, speakers, carpools, caravans, buses, our map. Text JAN6 to 86184 for security alerts and http://WildProtest.com   🇺🇸  @realDonaldTrump SHARE THIS LINK <br /><br />
                  We are the OFFICIAL #StopTheSteal group (@StopTheStealUS). No guilt trip emails, spammy texts or fake bus tours. We're not even a group. We're 150 groups and activists working with one another. We built the #DoNotCertify hashtag and caucus, working with Congressmen. Join us! <br /><br />
                  The purpose behind #JAN6 was in 3 conversations I had with @DrPaulGosar, @RepMoBrooks, and @EagleEdMartin. We want REPUBLICANS in the House and Senate to feel the base breathing down their necks. We want them to know we won't forget who will #FightForTrump and won't. 2022.

                  To clarify: last Friday night’s Oval Office discussion concerned making Sidney “White House Special Counsel” (not “ DOJ Special Counsel” or “DOJ Special Prosecutor”). Trump could do that without DOJ permission.

                  Time for Republican Senators to step up and fight for the Presidency, like the Democrats would do if they had actually won. The proof is irrefutable! Massive late night mail-in ballot drops in swing states, stuffing the ballot boxes (on video), double voters, dead voters,<br /><br />
                  ...fake signatures, illegal immigrant voters, banned Republican vote watchers, MORE VOTES THAN ACTUAL VOTERS (check out Detroit & Philadelphia), and much more. The numbers are far greater than what is necessary to win the individual swing states, and cannot even be contested....<br /><br />
                  ....Courts are bad, the FBI and “Justice” didn’t do their job, and the United States Election System looks like that of a third world country. Freedom of the press has been gone for a long time, it is Fake News, and now we have Big Tech (with Section 230) to deal with....<br /><br />
                  ....But when it is all over, and this period of time becomes just another ugly chapter in our Country’s history, WE WILL WIN!!!

                  I’m working on an effort to bus in 1000s of activists, including students, to the Capitol on #JAN6 in support of #StopTheSteal. If you have the resources to assist, DM me! We hope to secure 10 or so charter buses. The President wants us there, so we’re going to make it happen.

                  Race is only relevant because it was a Black Lives Matter sign, and the guy is black and Cuban. They can’t say he was “racist” or a “white supremacist” like they always try to do. Also, he didn’t even burn it so the whole thing is exceptionally stupid.

                When ghetto BLM does it, it’s “an expression of their pain.” When Trump supporters do the same, it’s “anti-democracy.” You’re trying to steal our country. Expect more of this.

                  Here’s what I see happening - a million or more people gathered in our nations capital today to make a stand toward election integrity in our republic. Some rabble rousers (affiliation at this point unknown) breached the barricades and overtook a very small amount (cont)<br /><br />
                  of security to storm the Capitol as deliberation was ongoing. Every political representative in our country was convened inside and they had tiny amounts of security to stop this. Interesting given how many people were there. (Cont)<br /><br />
                  hose people got in and caused undo amounts of chaos. The million people outside stood outside the Capitol - AS IS THEIR RIGHT - to protest a government gone rogue.<br /><br />
                  Now all of them are yelling at everyone to stop exercising their rights and leave and screaming about how abhorrent it is that they DARE BE UPSET that we’ve fundamentally lost our system of government to power hungry tyrants<br /><br />
                  They are singing songs and standing at the steps of the Capitol. There were a small amount who got in, but the rest were peacefully protesting a stolen federal election.<br /><br />
                  Politicians- you have stomped all over the American people for decades, only ramping up these past few years. You don’t follow the rule of law, you’ve corrupted our judicial system, effected a coup on our duly elected President, and done it all while stealing our tax dollars<br /><br />
                  and sending billions of them to help countries overseas. The people are ANGRY and they have every right to show you that through peaceful protest.<br /><br />
                  Stop telling Americans to “go home”. Lots of us are finished taking orders from you, you are not kings, and we are your boss. It’s our country, and if people want to stand in DC en masse to scream that - they will. No stores looted. No burning fires - just pissed off Americans<br /><br />
                  This election was stolen from the American people. Poor you for feeling the pressure of going along with it. And that goes for you blue checkmarks too. No one tells me “stop”.

                  At least one of the more aggressive protesters that broke into the Capitol has been identified.....and he’s a raging anti-Trumper. Why do you think he would be there, unless his intentions were to encourage and incite a mob? 🤔
